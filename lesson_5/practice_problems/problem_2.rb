Practice Problem 2
How would you order this array of hashes based on the year of
publication of each book, from the earliest to the latest?

books = [
  {title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez', published: '1967'},
  {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', published: '1925'},
  {title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy', published: '1869'},
  {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'}
]

**problem**

- input is an array of hashes
- ouput is the array with hashes oredered
  - based on the year of publication
  - in ascending order
- years in input are strings

**examples**

result:
[
  {title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy', published: '1869'},
  {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'},
  {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', published: '1925'},
  {title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez', published: '1967'}
]

**data structures**

array of hashes --> array of hashes

**algorithm**

- access the value of the `published` key in each hash within array
- sort by the the values
- return sorted array

  {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'}
]

sorted_books = books.sort_by do |hash|
  hash[:published]
end
